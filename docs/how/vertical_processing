<h1>What is Vertical processing and how does it work?</h1>
<p>Hi! In this article, I will talk about the concept and working of the vertical processing panel in StarLibV2. This topic is quite complex, and many people avoid it when creating their dynamic UI, but knowing how vertical processing work is very important because without it, your understanding of the work of a dynamic structure will be very close.</p>
<p>I will briefly talk about the concept of a dynamic UI. A dynamic UI is a UI whose appearance you configure through special parameters from the plugin or script itself. This is mainly done using dynamic buttons. The very basis of dynamic button construction is several buttons in one row, and keep in mind that all this will be done in one button factory. This is mainly done using the most popular scheme, which is used in StarLibV2 - dynamic sizers and vertical processing. It is highly recommended that you first read about dynamic sizers at the link below.</p>

<p>Yeah... It wasn't in the brief. Never mind! Dynamic sizes are responsible for the horizontal size of the button and its horizontal position, and the vertical processing panel is responsible for how the buttons sizing vertically and how they fall into one row.</p>
<p>The vertical processing panel makes your button factory think that the size of the button is zero, but at the same time gives you control over it. That is, you can make the button size normal (that is, with a collision) and with a zero vertical size. But then how does the button still look the way it would at a normal size? It's all about asynchronous vertical sizes. The main panel where the vertical sizer is located with the option to turn off (Becomes hided by binding). And the buffer panel, where our main element (Output) with sibiling size parameter is located, and another vertical sizer, which can no longer be turned off. This asynchrony allows you to quickly switch between different sizes. Yes, it is not very optimized, because you duplicate your bindings, if, for example, your vertical sizer has several variations of the vertical size. A more advanced technology has already been invented by me, but because of its closed source code, it is not available in StarLibV2.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope you have at least understood something from my story. It was quite difficult for me to formulate this. In any case, it's best for you to look at the open source vertical processing panel in the code of StarLibV2 itself. This technology is also used in the open source Dynamic UI example, which I also recommend you to look at.</p>
